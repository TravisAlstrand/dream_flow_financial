It is stressful looking at it and facing it but I feel very supported by her. She is never judgmental and always so encouraging and excited for any progress I make. She provides thorough notes of our sessions so I can just be present and listen and think about what I want and need financially. I would highly suggest trusting her with your financial darkness and letting her help you see the light!"
